Dedust MEV bot
============

It was the last half of 2024, I was working on TONChain, I thought it might be a good idea to write MEV bot for dedust, I spend almost 
4 months on it and it was harder then I was iniitially expected, the ending result is not good as I find some else are faster then me for most of the time. 

I quit the project after I lost nearly 1000 TON, the lost mainly due to inability to avoid the extreme condition which lost big money. 

I want to make this code public so that others can learn from my mistakes, and hopefully improve upon it.



Also I am looking for a job, if you are interested in hiring me, please contact me at [email](mailto:cming.xu@gmail.com)

BTW, I didn't strip some of keys that i used, TONAPI / TONCENTER API, you can used them too, but I didn't pay them for long time, 
so they may have rate of limit. You can replace with your professional subscription if you you want use it in serious condition.
